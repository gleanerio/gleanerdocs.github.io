# Config File


## Source

Sources can be defined as two types. A sitemap, which is a traditional sitemap that 
points to resources, or a sitemap index that points to a set of sitemaps.

The other is a sitegraph, which is a pre-computed graph for a site.  

Examples of their formats respectively are:

### sitemap

```yaml
 sourcetype: sitemap
  name: unidata
  logo: ""
  url: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/sitemap.xml
  headless: false
  pid: https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010355
  propername: UNIDATA
  domain: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/
  active: false
  credentialsfile: ""
  other: {}
  headlesswait: 0
  delay: 0
```

### sitegraph

```yaml  
- sourcetype: sitegraph
  name: aquadocs
  logo: ""
  url: https://oih.aquadocs.org/aquadocs.json
  headless: false
  pid: http://hdl.handle.net/1834/41372
  propername: AquaDocs
  domain: https://aquadocs.org
  active: false
  credentialsfile: ""
  other: {}
  headlesswait: 0
  delay: 0
```
